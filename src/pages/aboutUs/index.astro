                    <p>JavaZone is the biggest community-driven Java conference that has been organized in Oslo,
                        Norway since 2001. It is organized on a voluntary basis by a group of people from javaBin, the
                        Norwegian
                        Java User Group, working around the year and putting many hours to create an amazing conference
                        experience for you.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to organize a community-driven conference for developers where they can learn
                        new things, share knowledge, and socialize.</p>
                    <p>We are happy to see the event grow bigger and better every year. In 2019 we hosted over 3200
                        participants and 160 speakers across 7 parallel tracks over the course of two days. In addition,
                        we also
                        offered a selection of 11 workshops held on the day before the conference started.</p>

                    <p>Organizing a conference of this size on a voluntary basis is a lot of hard work (and it is
                        great fun too!). The conference organization is represented by the JavaZone Core Team – a group
                        of main
                        organizers of the conference, where each representative is responsible for one or several areas
                        or is
                        leading a group of other JUG members. An example of such groups can be Program Committee, IT
                        systems,
                        etc.</p>
