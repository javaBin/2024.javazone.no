            JAVAZONE?</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">JavaZone is the biggest community-driven Java conference that has been organized in Oslo,
                Norway since 2001. It is organized on a voluntary basis by a group of people from javaBin, the Norwegian
                Java User Group, working around the year and putting many hours to create an amazing conference
                experience for you.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Our goal is to organize a community-driven conference for developers where they can learn
                new things, share knowledge, and socialize.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We are happy to see the event grow bigger and better every year. In 2019 we hosted over 3200
                participants and 160 speakers across 7 parallel tracks over the course of two days. In addition, we also
                offered a selection of 11 workshops held on the day before the conference started.</p></section>
          <section class="text-base mb-4 "><h3 class="text-2xl leading-9 font-semibold text-big-text-color mb-4 ">WHO IS
            BEHIND IT?</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Organizing a conference of this size on a voluntary basis is a lot of hard work (and it is
                great fun too!). The conference organization is represented by the JavaZone Core Team – a group of main
                organizers of the conference, where each representative is responsible for one or several areas or is
                leading a group of other JUG members. An example of such groups can be Program Committee, IT systems,
                etc.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Being the biggest community-driven conference would not have been easy without all the
                partners, event coordinators, and subcontractors, so we would like to thank them as well! Thank you,
