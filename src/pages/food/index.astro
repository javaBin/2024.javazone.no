    <p>Welcome to JavaZone 2024, that promises to energize your taste buds and satisfy your cravings throughout the
        conference. We are happy to announce a collaboration with our long-term friends Hans-Kristian and Mathias from
        The Food Hub. They have been inspired by their travels and are looking forward to sharing their authentic
        cooking with you. Our eight restaurants will serve a diverse array of mouthwatering dishes, ensuring that
        attendees with various preferences and allergies can enjoy their meals to the fullest.</p>

    <p>For attendees with allergies or dietary restrictions, rest assured that each restaurant is committed to providing
        a
        safe and enjoyable dining experience. Our chefs are well-versed in accommodating gluten, nut, dairy, and other
        common allergies. We also have Halal options available at most of the restaurants.
        Simply inform the restaurant staff of your dietary needs, and they will guide you through the menu or offer
        personalized suggestions.</p>
