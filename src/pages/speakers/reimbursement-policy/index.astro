                        If your presentation or a workshop is accepted, you may apply for a refund for travel and
                        accommodation. Read below to find out if you are eligible.

                    <h2>How to apply</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first thing to note is that you need to <span class="bold">apply</span> for reimbursement of costs.
                        This is necessary for our budget planning. If you require financial support, please reach out to
                        <a href="mailto:refund@java.no">refund@java.no</a> after your session or workshop is accepted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this mail, provide an estimate of your travel expenses and the days you will be
                        visiting Oslo during the conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have a deal with a hotel, so if you need accommodation, we will reserve a room for you.
                        Please state in your application which days you are planning to stay. We do not refund
                        travel costs above the cost of a reasonably priced economy ticket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please also note that we do not refund travel expenses for those holding lightning talks.
                        However, speakers (including the ones holding lightning talks) will receive a free
                        conference ticket.

                    <h2>Confirmation & Reimbursement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Applications <span class="bold">must</span> be confirmed explicitly via
                        <a href="mailto:refund@java.no">refund@java.no</a> and are only accepted prior to our conference.
                        Reimbursements are provided after the conference. For this, we require you to send us copies of all
                        receipts, the name of your bank and international account numbers (IBAN, BIC/SWIFT, if available). We
                        reserve the right to decline a refund application. Speakers living in proximity to Oslo are not
                        eligible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reimbursements are processed and paid after the conference. We will reach out to speakers
                        who applied for reimbursement and process the payments once payment details are provided.
