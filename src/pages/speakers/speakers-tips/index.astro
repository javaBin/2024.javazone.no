        <h2>Increase the chance of your talk being accepted</h2>
        <p class="">
            There is generally a very high correlation between how much work one puts into the
            creation of a proposal and the chance that the proposal is accepted. Even a proposal with
            an extremely cool theme, entertaining title, and an experienced speaker may be excluded if
            the description is lacking.
        </p>
            <h3>We have gathered some tips that should be considered when
                writing a JavaZone proposal, and a few reasons why proposals may be rejected.</h3>

                    <h3>Create a good title</h3>
                    <p>
                        The title is the first thing people will see. A poorly worded title may be the only
                        thing
                        many will see of your proposal. A good title is catchy and concise, and should
                        describe
                        what you will talk about.

                    <h3>Write a catchy abstract</h3>
                    <p>
                        The abstract is what will be featured in the JavaZone program for the public to
                        read. If
                        the program committee doesn't believe that the abstract is good enough to convince
                        people
                        to come to your presentation, then the proposal won't be accepted.

                <p>
                    The outline is your chance to pitch the proposal to the program committee. This section
                    will not be published, but if your outline is thin or just a copy of your abstract, then
                    you're not selling yourself well.

                    <p>
                        With an exciting theme, it's easy to find many things one wants to present. Don't
                        get
                        carried away. Your proposal outline should explain how you will cover everything in
                        a
                        clear and structured manner.

                        If you've held the talk before, then please include links to any supporting material
                        that
                        you can show us. This could be video recordings, slide decks, blogs posts, GitHub

                <p>
                    Nothing says you haven't put much effort into your proposals like a submission form
                    filled
                    with 'TODO' or 'TBD' in the required fields. This is fine for the initial submission,
                    but
                    please make sure the required information is filled out properly by the submission
                    deadline.

                <p>
                    If your proposal is full of typos, it will be noticed (especially in key fields such as
                    the
                    title). This isn't a point that will necessarily mean the proposal will be rejected, but
                    it doesn't help your case.

                <p>
                    Live coding can make a presentation more entertaining, but it also increases the chances
                    of something going wrong. If the program committee doesn't get the feeling that you have
                    a
                    solid plan for the demonstration, then it might hurt your chances to be accepted.

                    If you have multiple things you can talk about, then submitting 2 or 3 different proposals
                    will increase your chances of finding a place in the schedule.

                    The program committee reviews hundreds of proposals each year. A few well-written
                    proposals are much more valuable than a bucket full of half-prepared ideas.

                    You will definitely be noticed IF YOUR TITLE IS ENTIRELY UPPERCASE (!!!!!!!!), but not

                Even though we are rooting for your talk to be accepted, the fact is that some talks
                must
                be rejected. Read through these tips to understand why this might happen. Even better,
                if
                you are reading this before the Call for Speakers deadline, you can go through your
                proposal and make sure you do your best to avoid these common pitfalls.

                    The program committee was not sure what you're going to present, or there was not enough
                    information about the technology/things you want to talk about to decide how awesome the

                <h3>The proposal is too thin</h3>
                <p>
                    The abstract doesn't convey the feeling that you have put a lot of work into it, or that
                    you have thought through your presentation.

                <p>
                    10-minute lightning talk proposals that appear to require double that time will be
                    discounted. The same applies to proposals that try to cover everything possible instead of
                    focusing on a specific area. If you want to cover a breadth of material, then be sure to
                    convey to us that you have thought through the timeline for your talk. We must feel that
                    you believe that it will work, something that can be achieved with a clear and detailed
                    outline.

                <h3>The abstract was not catchy enough</h3>
                <p>
                    If the committee ends up with 600 or so proposals to go through, time becomes a factor.
                    This is especially true in the first pass, and in the early stages. If your abstract
                    catches the fancy of just one or more of the committee members, your proposal is likely to
                    be thumbs-upped to the next phase. If not, it tends to drop out

                    Even though JavaZone has a place for many themes, there are some proposals that do not

                <p>
                    We often receive multiple good proposals covering exactly the same topic. The program
                    committee then has to decide between these multiple excellent submissions. In 2016 we
                    received many great proposals covering "how we do DevOps in the cloud". Limited space in
                    the program meant that many of these ended up being rejected.
