                    <h2>Increase the chance of your talk being accepted</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is generally a very high correlation between how much work one puts into the
                        creation of a proposal and the chance that the proposal is accepted. Even a proposal with
                        an extremely cool theme, entertaining title, and an experienced speaker may be excluded if
                        the description is lacking. We have gathered some tips that should be considered when
                        writing a JavaZone proposal, and a few reasons why proposals may be rejected.

                                    The title is the first thing people will see. A poorly worded title may be the only
                                    thing
                                    many will see of your proposal. A good title is catchy and concise, and should
                                    describe
                                    what you will talk about.

                                    The abstract is what will be featured in the JavaZone program for the public to
                                    read. If
                                    the program committee doesn't believe that the abstract is good enough to convince
                                    people
                                    to come to your presentation, then the proposal won't be accepted.

                                    carried away. Your proposal outline should explain how you will cover everything in
                                    a
                                    clear and structured manner.

                    <h2>Why was my talk rejected?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even though we are rooting for your talk to be accepted, the fact is that some talks must
                        be rejected. Read through these tips to understand why this might happen. Even better, if
                        you are reading this before the Call for Speakers deadline, you can go through your
                        proposal and make sure you do your best to avoid these common pitfalls.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Not Enough information</h3>
                    <p>
                        The program committee was not sure what you're going to present, or there was not enough
                        information about the technology/things you want to talk about to decide how awesome the
                        presentation will be.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The proposal is too thin</h3>
                    <p>
                        The abstract doesn't convey the feeling that you have put a lot of work into it, or that
                        you have thought through your presentation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        You want to talk about more than we think you will have time to cover
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        10-minute lightning talk proposals that appear to require double that time will be
                        discounted. The same applies to proposals that try to cover everything possible instead of
                        focusing on a specific area. If you want to cover a breadth of material, then be sure to
                        convey to us that you have thought through the timeline for your talk. We must feel that
                        you believe that it will work, something that can be achieved with a clear and detailed
                        outline.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The abstract was not catchy enough</h3>
                    <p>
                        If the committee ends up with 600 or so proposals to go through, time becomes a factor.
                        This is especially true in the first pass, and in the early stages. If your abstract
                        catches the fancy of just one or more of the committee members, your proposal is likely to
                        be thumbs-upped to the next phase. If not, it tends to drop out of the race early. It will
                        help your chances to describe accurately and concisely what you want to talk about, and
                        why people should come and listen to you.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        The theme did not fit in with what we want to include in the program this year
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Even though JavaZone has a place for many themes, there are some proposals that do not
                        fit. Some proposals are rejected because we feel the presentation would be better served
                        at a different conference.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Your co-presenter had a different proposal accepted</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you intend to present with a co-presenter, and she happens to have had a separate
                        proposal already accepted, then we may have to reject your joint proposal.
                    </p>

                    <h3>You were unlucky</h3>
                    <p>
                        We often receive multiple good proposals covering exactly the same topic. The program
                        committee then has to decide between these multiple excellent submissions. In 2016 we
                        received many great proposals covering "how we do DevOps in the cloud". Limited space in
                        the program meant that many of these ended up being rejected.
